# Bucket ListR

## Overview
For project #3, I created a bucket list app, named "Bucket Listr". This app allows users to create their own personal bucket list. Users can also view other user's bucket list.

This app consists of two models: User and Items. The User model has full CRUD capabilities, while the Items model has Add and Delete capabilities.
